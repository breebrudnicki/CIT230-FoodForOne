            <h1>Homemade Pizza</h1>
            <img src="../images/recipes/pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza" class="long">
            <p>Homemade pizza is among one of the best things on earth and so fun to make with friends. For a while, my roommates and I made Pizza every Friday. It was quite the tradition. All you need is a good dough recipe (Check out <a href="http://www.sugardishme.com/10-minute-pizza-dough/">Sugar Dish Me's</a>), some pizza sauce (we always use pasta sauce because we have it on hand), and your favorite pizza toppings! Invite some friends over and have fun with it.</p>
