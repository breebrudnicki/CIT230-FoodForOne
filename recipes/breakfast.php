            <p>I love this recipe because it's super easy. All you need to do is throw it together the night before and your breakfast is ready to go in the morning</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                    <li>Sweetner to taste (brown sugar, honey, syrup, you're call!)</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <p>Put oats and milk in a mason jar and put it in the firdge overnight. In the morning the oats will have absorbed the milk and your oatmeal will be ready to eat. Just be sure to add something in to sweeten it, unless you're into plain oatmeal, which in that case is totally cool.</p>
            <p>See, easy!</p>

            <h1>Open Banana Sandwich</h1>
            <a href="http://talesofakitchen.com/breakfast/almond-butter-and-banana-open-sandwich/"><img src="../images/recipes/banana.jpg" alt="Open Banana Sandwhich" class="long"></a>
            <p>This recipe is see easy and good for you! I'm sure you can figure out how to make it just by looking at it, but feel free to visit the site it came from <a href="http://talesofakitchen.com/breakfast/almond-butter-and-banana-open-sandwich/">(Tales of a Kitchen)</a>. When I make this I usually simplify it because I have less ingredients, but you can do whatever your heart desires. I usually just slice a banana in half, and spread some peanut butter and honey over it.</p>
        <p>Super simple, super filling. Enjoy!</p>
