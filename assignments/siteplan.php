        <li>What should I get at the grocery store?</li>
        <li>What are pantry staples?</li>

        <li>Grocery list templates
            <ul>
                <li>A couple different lists of groceries and ideas. There will be a super basic list of groceries that have staples everyone should always have on hand. There will also be a list of things to keep on hand if you enjoy baking frequently. There can also be a grocery list of things to keep on hand if you plan on eating sandwiches everyday. At the top of the page there will be a photo of groceries. Ideally, I think it would be cool to have a grocery list maker, so the user could look at recipes and put together their own list based on the things they want to eat that week.</li>
