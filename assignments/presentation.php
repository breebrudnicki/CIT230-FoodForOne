        <h1>CSS syntax: Rule, Declaration, Property, Value</h1>
        <h4>Rule:</h4>
        <p>A rule is exactly what it sounds like, it dictates how your content what your content is going to look like. A rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.</p>
        <img src="../images/assignments/cssrule.jpg" alt="CSS Rule">
        <h4>Selector: </h4>
        <p>The selector tells us which element your rule is applied to. You can apply a rule to more than one element by using commas. </p>
        <h4>Declaration: </h4>
        <p>The declaration tells us how to style the elements that you have selected. The declaration is nested within the curly brackets that follow the selector. The content of a declaration consists of two parts: property and value. Property and value are separated by a colon and each declaration is separated by a semicolon.</p>
        <h4>Property: </h4>
        <p>The property is the part of the element you want to change. This may be the color, font, width, height, or border.</p>
        <h4>Values: </h4>
        <p>The value is what you want to apply to the property. If you decided you wanted to change the font, this is where you would tell what font you want.</p>
